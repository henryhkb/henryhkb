### Hi, I'm Henry Kofi Brandoh 👋 🙂
I am an IT Manager and Full-Stack Engineer from Ghana 🇬🇭 with a strong foundation in the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). I specialize in designing and building scalable, secure, and well-architected web applications that solve real-world operational problems particularly in healthcare and logistics environments.
My passion for software engineering lies in transforming ideas into structured systems with clean architecture, maintainable code, and practical impact. I approach development not only as a builder but also as a systems thinker.

🔐 Security-Focused Development
- Security is a core part of my engineering philosophy.
- I actively apply OWASP Top 10 vulnerability awareness and secure coding practices to ensure that the systems I build are reliable and safe for users and organizations.
- I believe software should not only work — it should be resilient.
